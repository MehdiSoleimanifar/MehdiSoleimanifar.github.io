The classical analog of this problem, known as learning graphical models or Boltzmann machines, is a well-studied question in machine learning and statistics. In this work, we give the first sample-efficient algorithm for the quantum Hamiltonian learning problem. In particular, we prove that polynomially many samples in the number of particles (qudits) are necessary and sufficient for learning the parameters of a spatially local Hamiltonian in l_2-norm. Our main contribution is in establishing the strong convexity of the log-partition function of quantum many-body systems, which along with the maximum entropy estimation yields our sample-efficient algorithm. Classically, the strong convexity for partition functions follows from the Markov property of Gibbs distributions. This is, however, known to be violated in its exact form in the quantum case. We introduce several new ideas to obtain an unconditional result that avoids relying on the Markov property of quantum systems, at the cost of a slightly weaker bound. In particular, we prove a lower bound on the variance of quasi-local operators with respect to the Gibbs state, which might be of independent interest. Our work paves the way toward a more rigorous application of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body problems.","tags":null,"title":"Sample-efficient learning of quantum many-body systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aram Harrow","Saeed Mehraban","Mehdi Soleimanifar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571529600,"objectID":"e1e5cac8d9e98f97b8bad1ace1a7fef1","permalink":"https://MehdiSoleimanifar.github.io/publication/partition_function_hms/","publishdate":"2019-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/partition_function_hms/","section":"publication","summary":"Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) 2020","tags":null,"title":"Classical algorithms, correlation decay, and complex zeros of partition functions of quantum many-body systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571443200,"objectID":"17d762dd71fd848bf2f59d44d3c64025","permalink":"https://MehdiSoleimanifar.github.io/talk/power_of_qc/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/power_of_qc/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Power of Quantum Computers","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.   -- ","date":1563894000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563894000,"objectID":"444417ab31cc64465ccad85a7f368888","permalink":"https://MehdiSoleimanifar.github.io/talk/partition_function_caltech/","publishdate":"2019-07-23T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/partition_function_caltech/","section":"talk","summary":"Basic statistical properties of quantum many-body systems in thermal equilibrium including the free energy, entropy, and average energy can be obtained from the partition function. This talk will focus on the problem of estimating the partition function which has been the subject of various numerical and theoretical studies both in statistical physics and computer science. It is well known that this problem is computationally hard in the worst case. In this talk, I will present a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that estimates the partition function of quantum many-body systems above the phase transition point.\nThe algorithm extrapolates the solution at high temperatures where the problem is easy to low temperatures where finding the solution is harder. The running time of this algorithm relies on the locus of the complex zeros of the partition function. I will talk about cases where we can locate these complex zeros. I will also discuss the relation between other signatures of the phase transition such as the exponential decay of correlations and the locus of these zeros.\nThis is based on joint work with Aram Harrow and Saeed Mehraban.","tags":[],"title":"Counting without Sampling: Approximation Algorithms for Quantum Many-Body Systems at Finite Temperatures","type":"talk"}]
